<!-- requires Android SDK 20

    We used to try to optimize the build, only compiling when the
source had changed. But the Android SDK tools are not set up for that,
so it's difficult to get the dependencies correct, and even harder to
update this file when a new SDK is released. So we just use the
default setup.

<!--
This determines the apk name. The installed app name (in Android
applications manager) is in res/values/strings.xml app_name. But
changing these two does _not_ allow installing two copies of the app
side by side; that requires changing all the class names. Changing the
apk name does help in knowing which one you are installing.
