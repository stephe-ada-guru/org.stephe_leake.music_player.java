Description: Emacs front-end to distributed version control systems
 DVC is an attempt to build a common infrastructure for various
 distributed revision control systems. Currently, only GNU Arch is
 fully supported, but there are ongoing works to support bzr,
 mercurial and cogito.
 .
 GNU arch is a revision control system with features that are ideal for
 projects characterised by widely distributed development, concurrent
 support of multiple releases, and substantial amounts of development
 on branches.  It can be a replacement for CVS and corrects many
 mis-features of that system.
 .
 DVC is the successor of Xtla, an Emacs front-end to the GNU Arch
 clients tla and bazaar. It provides the user wrappers for most tla
 and bazaar commands, plus higher level commands. In particular:
 .
  * PCL-CVS like interface for tla inventory.
  * Archive browser. Navigate painlessly in archives, categories,
    branches, versions, ...
  * Bookmark manager. Keep the most frequently used arch locations in
    your bookmark buffer.
  * Integration of ediff, Emacs's graphical diff tool.
  * Interface to view missing patches from all your partners with a
    single command.
  * An Emacs mode for arch related files (log files, =tagging-method).
