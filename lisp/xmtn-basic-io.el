;;; Commentary:

;; This library helps parse data in monotone's basic_io format.
;;
;; See docstrings for details.

;;; Code:

;;; There are some notes on the design of xmtn in
;;; docs/xmtn-readme.txt.

;;; I haven't seen a specification for monotone's basic_io format.
;;; I'm implementing this parser somewhat defensively.

;;; Maybe strings in basic_io are always encoded as UTF-8?  In that
;;; case, the decoding code for filenames and cert names/values that
;;; is currently spread across several functions could be moved
;;; directly in here.

;;; `parse-partial-sexp'/`scan-sexps', with an appropriate syntax
;;; table, looks like the best way to do this kind of parsing.  It is
;;; very likely faster than anything we can implement by hand in Emacs
;;; Lisp.

;;; Much of the code in here has been tuned for speed quite a bit.
;;; Careful with refactorings!  For example, introducing a variable
;;; binding that the byte-compiler can't optimize away can mean a
;;; major slowdown.

;;; Using cons cells instead of two-element lists is only a very minor
;;; performance advantage (<.5%).  Also, with cons cells, `null-id'
;;; would have to be a bare symbol, while `id' and `string' would be
;;; cons cells; with lists, the representation is more uniform.

BUFFER-FORM should evaluate to a buffer that contains, between
\(point-min\) and \(point-max\), zero or more lines in monotone's
basic_io format.

BODY will be evaluated with LINE-PARSER \(a symbol\) bound to a
closure that will, each time it is called, return the next line
in parsed form, or the symbol `eof' if there are no more lines.

Empty lines are returned as the symbol `empty'.

Each non-empty line is a list of a key and zero or more fields.
The key is a string.  Each field is either a one-element list
\(null-id\) and represents an empty ID field \(what monotone
prints as \[\] in basic_io format\), a two-element list \(id
HASH-ID\), where HASH-ID is a string of forty hexadecimal digits
\(what monotone prints as \[HASH-ID\]\), or a two-element list
\(string STRING\), where STRING is a string (what monotone prints
as \"STRING\"\).

Lines and their contents are always fresh objects.

The macro `xmtn-match' is a useful way to process basic_io lines
parsed this way.

The parser should be assumed to have dynamic extent.  If the
contents of the buffer that BUFFER-FORM evaluates to, or the
position of point in that buffer, are modified from within BODY
\(other than by calling the parser\), the parser becomes invalid
and must not be called any more."
